# Module 4 Testing Report: "Mapping Your Tax Exposure"

## Summary of Findings

After comprehensive testing of Module 4 in "The Escape Blueprint" course, I've identified several issues that need to be addressed before the module can be considered fully implemented according to requirements.

## What's Working Correctly

1. **Course Structure**:
   - ✅ Module 4 "Mapping Your Tax Exposure" is properly displayed in the course
   - ✅ The subtitle "Module 4 of 5" appears correctly
   - ✅ The sidebar shows 8 total lessons as expected

2. **Content Assessment Framework**:
   - ✅ The module content appears to be properly displayed with the self-assessment framework
   - ✅ Content includes sections for Income Analysis, Entity Structure Review, Deduction Strategy Analysis, and Common Exposure Patterns
   - ✅ The 3-step self-assessment process is visible in the content

3. **Enhanced Glossary Integration**:
   - ✅ All 4 glossary buttons for Module 4 are present: AGI, Deduction Bandwidth, Income Type Stack, and Entity Exposure
   - ✅ Glossary buttons function correctly, displaying term definitions in a modal

## Issues Identified

1. **Quiz Questions Issue**:
   - ❌ The quiz questions for Module 4 are not the specific tax exposure assessment questions as required
   - ❌ Instead, the quiz shows general course questions from the entire course
   - ❌ None of the expected Module 4 questions were found in the quiz

2. **XP Discrepancy**:
   - ❌ The quiz button shows "Start Quiz (30 XP Available)" instead of the expected 40 XP
   - ❌ This doesn't match the requirement of 40 XP for Module 4

3. **End CTA Issue**:
   - ❌ The expected end CTA text "In the final module, you'll learn how to build your personalized roadmap..." is not present in the content
   - ❌ The last paragraph of the content is instead: "The goal isn't to implement every strategy - it's to identify the 2-3 levers that will have the biggest impact on your specific situation and create a plan to implement them systematically."

## Root Causes

1. **Quiz Questions Issue**:
   - The QuizQuestion model in the backend doesn't have a module_id field, only a course_id field
   - All quiz questions are associated with the course (primer_course.id) but not with specific modules
   - The API endpoint `/courses/{course_id}/quiz` retrieves all questions for a course without filtering by module
   - The frontend's startQuiz function doesn't pass any module information when fetching quiz questions

2. **XP Discrepancy**:
   - The quiz button in the frontend shows "Start Quiz (30 XP Available)" hardcoded in the UI
   - This value is not dynamically set based on the module's XP value

3. **End CTA Issue**:
   - The end CTA text was not added to the Module 4 content in the server.py file

## Recommended Fixes

1. **For Quiz Questions**:
   - Update the QuizQuestion model to include a module_id field
   - Modify the API endpoint to filter questions by both course_id and module_id
   - Tag the quiz questions for Module 4 with the appropriate module_id
   - Update the frontend to pass the current module_id when fetching quiz questions

2. **For XP Discrepancy**:
   - Update the hardcoded "30 XP Available" text to "40 XP Available" for Module 4
   - Ideally, make this dynamic based on the module's XP value

3. **For End CTA**:
   - Add the end CTA text to the Module 4 content in the server.py file

## Conclusion

While the basic structure and content of Module 4 are in place, there are implementation issues with the quiz questions, XP display, and end CTA that need to be addressed before the module can be considered fully implemented according to requirements.
