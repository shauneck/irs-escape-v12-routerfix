The enhanced module layout structure is implemented with gradient header, video player placeholder, and content area. Sidebar components (Case Study and Key Terms) are present and working correctly. However, the 'What You'll Learn' sections are missing from all tested modules. None of the modules display the tactical bullet points with <strong> formatting as required."

        comment: "Verified that the 'What You'll Learn' sections are now properly implemented in the backend data for all modules. The sections are formatted with HTML <ul> and <li> tags, and the content includes <strong> formatting for tactical content. Examined the specific modules mentioned in the review request: W-2 Module 1 ('The Real Problem with W-2 Income'), Primer Module 1 ('Why You're Overpaying the IRS'), and Business Module 1 ('Entity Structuring & Income Capture'). All three modules now have properly formatted 'What You'll Learn' sections with bullet points and tactical content with <strong> formatting. The ModuleViewer component in App.js correctly extracts and renders these sections with the extractWhatYoullLearn function. The function properly handles both HTML-formatted sections and markdown-style bullet points, ensuring compatibility with different content formats. The UI renders the bullet points with proper styling and the <strong> tags are correctly displayed for emphasis."
