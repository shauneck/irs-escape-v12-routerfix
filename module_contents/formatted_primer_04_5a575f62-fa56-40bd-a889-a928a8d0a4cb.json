This module will guide you through a systematic self-assessment of your current situation and help you identify which levers apply to your specific circumstances.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Break down your current income types (W-2, equity, business, rental)</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Learn how entity structure impacts your planning options</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Identify where timing, stacking, and reinvestment gaps exist</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Use the Exposure Mapping Tool to identify leverage opportunities</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Apply this map to the Escape Plan strategy builder in Module 6</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Your Tax Exposure Assessment\n\nUnderstanding your tax exposure requires analyzing four key areas:\n\n### 1. Income Analysis - Your **AGI** Foundation\n\n**Current Income Sources:**\n\u2022 What types of income do you currently receive? (W-2, 1099, K-1, capital gains, rental, etc.)\n\u2022 How much control do you have over the timing of this income?\n\u2022 Are you maximizing or minimizing the AGI that determines your tax bracket?\n\n**Income Type Stack Assessment:**\nYour **Income Type Stack** determines not just how much you pay, but when you pay it. W-2 income hits immediately with limited deferral options, while business income offers significantly more control. Understanding your AGI composition is crucial for optimization.\n\n### 2. Entity Structure Review - Your **Entity Exposure**\n\n**Current Structure:**\n\u2022 Are you operating as a sole proprietor, LLC, S-Corp, or C-Corp?\n\u2022 Is your current entity structure optimized for your income level and business activities?\n\u2022 What is your Entity Exposure - how much risk are you taking by not optimizing your structure?\n\n**Optimization Opportunities:**\nDifferent entity types offer different advantages. Higher-income individuals often benefit from more sophisticated structures that provide better tax treatment and asset protection. Reducing your Entity Exposure should be a priority for growing businesses.\n\n### 3. Deduction Strategy Analysis - Your **Deduction Bandwidth**\n\n**Current Deductions:**\n\u2022 Are you maximizing standard vs. itemized deductions?\n\u2022 What business deductions are you currently claiming?\n\u2022 How much Deduction Bandwidth do you have - the gap between what you're claiming and what you could legally claim?\n\n**Missed Opportunities:**\nMost high earners leave significant deductions on the table because they don't have the right structures in place to capture them. Expanding your Deduction Bandwidth often requires proactive planning and proper documentation.\n\n### 4. Risk Exposure Mapping\n\n**Tax Risk Assessment:**\n\u2022 How vulnerable are you to tax rate increases?\n\u2022 Are you overly dependent on one income type?\n\u2022 Do you have strategies in place for major income events (bonuses, stock vesting, business sales)?\n\n**Future Planning:**\n\u2022 What major income or life events are coming up?\n\u2022 How will your current structure handle increased income?\n\u2022 What's your exit strategy for current investments and business interests?\n\n## Self-Assessment Framework\n\n**Step 1: Document Your Current State**\n\u2022 List all income sources and their tax treatment\n\u2022 Identify your current entity structure and its limitations\n\u2022 Calculate your effective tax rate and compare to optimal scenarios\n\n**Step 2: Identify Your Biggest Opportunities**\n\u2022 Which of the 6 levers offers the most immediate impact?\n\u2022 What's your highest-value, lowest-risk optimization?\n\u2022 Where are you leaving the most money on the table?\n\n**Step 3: Prioritize Your Action Items**\n\u2022 What can be implemented before year-end?\n\u2022 What requires longer-term planning and structure changes?\n\u2022 What professional help do you need to execute properly?\n\n## Common Exposure Patterns\n\n**High-Income W-2 Earners:**\n\u2022 Typically over-exposed to ordinary income tax rates\n\u2022 Limited deduction opportunities without additional structures\n\u2022 Often missing real estate or business deduction strategies\n\n**Business Owners:**\n\u2022 May be using suboptimal entity structures for their income level\n\u2022 Often missing advanced deduction and timing strategies\n\u2022 Frequently lack proper exit planning for their business assets\n\n**Investors and High-Net-Worth Individuals:**\n\u2022 May have poor asset location strategies\n\u2022 Often missing Opportunity Zone and other advanced deferral strategies\n\u2022 Frequently lack coordination between different advisors and strategies\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\nThe goal isn't to implement every strategy - it's to identify the 2-3 levers that will have the biggest impact on your specific situation and create a plan to implement them systematically.\n\nIn the final module, you'll learn how to build your personalized roadmap using the tools, glossary terms, and playbooks in your account. You're almost there."
