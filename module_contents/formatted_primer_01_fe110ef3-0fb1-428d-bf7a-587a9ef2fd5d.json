Every dollar you keep starts with one or more of these.\n\nMost people think taxes are about forms. They're not \u2014 they're about structure, timing, and positioning.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Understand how your tax rate is driven by income type, entity, and timing</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>See how W-2 income blocks most strategic options</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Learn why wealthy families use leverage, not labor</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Break down how different income flows generate deductions or drag</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Learn how to evaluate your return using the 6-lever model</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## The 6 Core Levers\n\n### 1. Entity Type\n\u2022 Your **entity structure** determines your tax ceiling.\n\u2022 C-Corp, S-Corp, MSO, or Schedule C \u2014 they're not all created equal.\n\u2022 Strategically managing entity types is how business owners avoid double taxation and unlock deduction control.\n\n### 2. Income Type\n\u2022 Not all income is taxed equally.\n\u2022 W-2, 1099, K-1, capital gains, passive flow \u2014 each has a different tax treatment.\n\u2022 You don't need to earn less. You need to earn differently.\n\n### 3. Timing\n\u2022 Tax timing is a weapon \u2014 not a constraint.\n\u2022 Installment sales, deferred comp, Roth conversions, asset rollovers all leverage when income hits.\n\n### 4. Asset Location\n\u2022 Where your assets live changes how they're taxed.\n\u2022 Insurance wrappers, retirement accounts, real estate, and **Opportunity Zones** all have unique benefits.\n\n### 5. Deduction Strategy\n\u2022 Most CPAs miss over 50% of the deductions available.\n\u2022 True planning involves orchestrating deductions through energy, depreciation, trust layering, and timing.\n\n### 6. Exit Planning\n\u2022 If you build wealth but don't plan your exit, the IRS cashes out with you.\n\u2022 QSBS, Opportunity Zones, charitable trusts, and stepped-up basis strategy all come into play here.\n\n## Application\n\nThese levers apply to:\n\u2022 \u2705 Business owners shifting to MSO or C-Corp models\n\u2022 \u2705 W-2 earners creating deduction pathways using **asset location**\n\u2022 \u2705 Real estate professionals leveraging depreciation\n\u2022 \u2705 Exit events (business sale, asset sale, vesting RSUs)\n\nEach future module in this course \u2014 and in the full IRS Escape Plan platform \u2014 ties back to one or more of these 6 levers.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nYou now have the lens. Every tax strategy moving forward pulls on one or more of these levers. In the next module, we'll walk through real-world case studies \u2014 showing exactly how W-2 earners and business owners legally reposition their income, time their exits, and keep hundreds of thousands more. Let's get tactical."
