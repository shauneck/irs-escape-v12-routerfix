## Hook

You don't need 600 tax strategies. You need 6 levers — the ones that actually move the needle. Every dollar you keep starts with one or more of these.

## Lesson Summary

Most people think taxes are about forms. They're not — they're about structure, timing, and positioning. In this module, you'll learn the six foundational levers that every high-income strategy is built around:

## The 6 Core Levers

### 1. Entity Type
• **Your entity structure determines your tax ceiling.**
• C-Corp, S-Corp, MSO, or Schedule C — they're not all created equal.
• Strategically managing entity types is how business owners avoid double taxation and unlock deduction control.

### 2. Income Type
• **Not all income is taxed equally.**
• W-2, 1099, K-1, capital gains, passive flow — each has a different tax treatment.
• You don't need to earn less. You need to earn differently.

### 3. Timing
• **Tax timing is a weapon — not a constraint.**
• Installment sales, deferred comp, Roth conversions, asset rollovers all leverage when income hits.

### 4. Asset Location
• **Where your assets live changes how they're taxed.**
• Insurance wrappers, retirement accounts, real estate, and Opportunity Zones all have unique benefits.

### 5. Deduction Strategy
• **Most CPAs miss over 50% of the deductions available.**
• True planning involves orchestrating deductions through energy, depreciation, trust layering, and timing.

### 6. Exit Planning
• **If you build wealth but don't plan your exit, the IRS cashes out with you.**
• QSBS, Opportunity Zones, charitable trusts, and stepped-up basis strategy all come into play here.

## Application

These levers apply to:
• ✅ **Business owners** shifting to MSO or C-Corp models
• ✅ **W-2 earners** creating deduction pathways using asset placement
• ✅ **Real estate professionals** leveraging depreciation
• ✅ **Exit events** (business sale, asset sale, vesting RSUs)

Each future module in this course — and in the full IRS Escape Plan platform — ties back to one or more of these 6 levers.

## Glossary Terms

## End CTA

You now have the lens. Every tax strategy moving forward pulls on one or more of these levers.
