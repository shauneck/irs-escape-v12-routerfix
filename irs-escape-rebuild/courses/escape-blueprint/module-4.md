## Overview

Now that you understand the levers and have seen them in action, it's time to map your own tax exposure. This module will guide you through a systematic self-assessment of your current situation and help you identify which levers apply to your specific circumstances.

## Your Tax Exposure Assessment

Understanding your tax exposure requires analyzing four key areas:

### 1. Income Analysis - Your **AGI** Foundation

**Current Income Sources:**
• What types of income do you currently receive? (W-2, 1099, K-1, capital gains, rental, etc.)
• How much control do you have over the timing of this income?
• Are you maximizing or minimizing the **AGI** that determines your tax bracket?

**Income Type Stack Assessment:**
Your **Income Type Stack** determines not just how much you pay, but when you pay it. W-2 income hits immediately with limited deferral options, while business income offers significantly more control.

### 2. Entity Structure Review - Your **Entity Exposure**

**Current Structure:**
• Are you operating as a sole proprietor, LLC, S-Corp, or C-Corp?
• Is your current entity structure optimized for your income level and business activities?
• What is your **Entity Exposure** - how much risk are you taking by not optimizing your structure?

**Optimization Opportunities:**
Different entity types offer different advantages. Higher-income individuals often benefit from more sophisticated structures that provide better tax treatment and asset protection.

### 3. Deduction Strategy Analysis - Your **Deduction Bandwidth**

**Current Deductions:**
• Are you maximizing standard vs. itemized deductions?
• What business deductions are you currently claiming?
• How much **Deduction Bandwidth** do you have - the gap between what you're claiming and what you could legally claim?

**Missed Opportunities:**
Most high earners leave significant deductions on the table because they don't have the right structures in place to capture them.

### 4. Risk Exposure Mapping

**Tax Risk Assessment:**
• How vulnerable are you to tax rate increases?
• Are you overly dependent on one income type?
• Do you have strategies in place for major income events (bonuses, stock vesting, business sales)?

**Future Planning:**
• What major income or life events are coming up?
• How will your current structure handle increased income?
• What's your exit strategy for current investments and business interests?

## Self-Assessment Framework

**Step 1: Document Your Current State**
• List all income sources and their tax treatment
• Identify your current entity structure and its limitations
• Calculate your effective tax rate and compare to optimal scenarios

**Step 2: Identify Your Biggest Opportunities**
• Which of the 6 levers offers the most immediate impact?
• What's your highest-value, lowest-risk optimization?
• Where are you leaving the most money on the table?

**Step 3: Prioritize Your Action Items**
• What can be implemented before year-end?
• What requires longer-term planning and structure changes?
• What professional help do you need to execute properly?

## Common Exposure Patterns

**High-Income W-2 Earners:**
• Typically over-exposed to ordinary income tax rates
• Limited deduction opportunities without additional structures
• Often missing real estate or business deduction strategies

**Business Owners:**
• May be using suboptimal entity structures for their income level
• Often missing advanced deduction and timing strategies
• Frequently lack proper exit planning for their business assets

**Investors and High-Net-Worth Individuals:**
• May have poor asset location strategies
• Often missing Opportunity Zone and other advanced deferral strategies
• Frequently lack coordination between different advisors and strategies

## Glossary Terms

- **AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)**: Your total income minus specific deductions - determines tax bracket
- **Deduction Bandwidth**: Gap between current and potential deductions with proper structuring
- **Income Type Stack**: Combination and layering of different income types
- **Entity Exposure**: Risk from operating under suboptimal business entity structure

## Your Next Steps

The goal isn't to implement every strategy - it's to identify the 2-3 levers that will have the biggest impact on your specific situation and create a plan to implement them systematically.
