## Hook

You've seen the levers ‚Äî now see what happens when real people pull them. These are not theoretical savings. These are real shifts from W-2 earners and business owners who rewired their tax exposure and kept six figures more.

## Lesson Summary

This module walks through anonymized client case studies that reflect exactly how the 6 levers are used in real scenarios. These examples will show you how a shift in entity, income type, deduction strategy, or timing can result in transformational tax savings.

## Case Study 1 ‚Äì W-2 Earner With RSUs

**Client:** "Noah" (Tech Executive)  
**Income:** $550K W-2 + $380K capital gains from RSUs

**Levers Pulled:**
‚Ä¢ **Capital gains deferred** using a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF)
‚Ä¢ **Basis invested** in STR real estate for depreciation
‚Ä¢ **Net W-2 tax liability reduced by $96K**

**üí° Lesson:** Capital gains don't need to be cashed out ‚Äî they can be repositioned for long-term tax-free growth while offsetting current W-2 tax.

**The Strategy:**
Noah was facing a massive tax bill from his RSU vesting. Instead of paying capital gains tax immediately, he invested the proceeds into a Qualified Opportunity Fund, deferring the gains. The QOF investment went into short-term rental properties, generating depreciation that offset his W-2 income. Result: $96K tax savings in year one, with the potential for tax-free growth over 10+ years.

## Case Study 2 ‚Äì Business Owner S-Corp Rollover

**Client:** "Jessica" (Agency Owner)  
**Income:** $720K net income via S-Corp

**Levers Pulled:**
‚Ä¢ **Management fee routed** to C-Corp MSO (Management Services Organization)
‚Ä¢ **Retained earnings invested** into Oil & Gas and equipment bonus depreciation
‚Ä¢ **Effective tax liability dropped from $278K ‚Üí $122K**

**üí° Lesson:** Entity structure and asset pairing can transform the taxation of earned income and convert retained earnings into deduction-fueled passive cash flow.

**The Strategy:**
Jessica's agency was generating substantial profits as an S-Corp, but she was paying high personal tax rates on all the income. By creating a C-Corp MSO structure, she could retain earnings at lower corporate rates and invest them in bonus depreciation assets (oil & gas, equipment). This strategy saved her $156K in taxes while building long-term wealth through appreciating assets.

## Case Study 3 ‚Äì W-2 + Real Estate

**Client:** "Liam" (Medical Professional)  
**Income:** $400K W-2 + $120K net from STR (Virginia)

**Levers Pulled:**
‚Ä¢ **Qualified as Real Estate Professional (REPS)** via material participation
‚Ä¢ **STR depreciation offset $118K of W-2** income
‚Ä¢ **Rental income reinvested** into index fund via DCA

**üí° Lesson:** You don't need a business to get proactive. Real estate and depreciation rules can transform how income is taxed ‚Äî even if you have a W-2 job.

**The Strategy:**
Liam was earning high W-2 income as a medical professional but wanted to reduce his tax burden. By qualifying for Real Estate Professional Status through material participation in his short-term rental properties, he could use the depreciation from his STR portfolio to offset his W-2 income. This strategy eliminated nearly $118K of taxable income while building a growing real estate portfolio.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple Lever Approach:** Each case study shows how combining multiple levers creates exponential results
2. **Income Type Conversion:** Converting high-tax W-2 income into lower-tax investment income
3. **Timing Optimization:** Strategic deferral and acceleration of income and deductions
4. **Entity Leverage:** Using the right business structures to access better tax treatment
5. **Asset Positioning:** Placing the right investments in the right structures for maximum benefit

## Glossary Terms

- **Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF)**: Tax-advantaged investment vehicle for capital gains deferral
- **Bonus Depreciation**: Immediate deduction for eligible asset purchases
- **REPS (Real Estate Professional Status)**: Tax classification for rental real estate loss deductions
- **Depreciation Offset**: Using depreciation to reduce taxable income from other sources
- **STR (Short-Term Rental)**: Rental properties with favorable tax treatment

These aren't loopholes. They're strategies ‚Äî structured, code-backed, and available to anyone who stops playing defense.
